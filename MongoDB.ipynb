What are the key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases\n","\n","Ans:SQL is relational, uses structured schema and joins; NoSQL like MongoDB is document-based, schema-less, and more flexible.\n","\n","2.  What makes MongoDB a good choice for modern applications?\n","\n","Ans: It offers high scalability, flexibility, and handles unstructured data well.\n","\n","3.  Explain the concept of collections in MongoDB?\n","\n","Ans: Collections are groups of MongoDB documents, similar to tables in SQL.\n","\n","4.  How does MongoDB ensure high availability using replication?\n","\n","Ans: MongoDB uses replica sets (primary + secondary nodes) for failover and redundancy.\n","\n","5.  What are the main benefits of MongoDB Atlas?\n","\n","Ans: Managed cloud service, automatic backups, scalability, security, and monitoring.\n","\n","6.  What is the role of indexes in MongoDB, and how do they improve performance?\n","\n","Ans: Indexes speed up query performance by allowing faster data retrieval.\n","\n","7.  Describe the stages of the MongoDB aggregation pipeline?\n","\n","Ans:Typical stages: $match, $group, $sort, $project, $limit, $lookup.\n","\n","8.  What is sharding in MongoDB? How does it differ from replication?\n","\n","Ans:  Sharding = horizontal scaling; replication = data redundancy and high availability.\n","\n","9.  What is PyMongo, and why is it used?\n","\n","Ans: A Python driver to interact with MongoDB from Python applications.\n","\n","10.  What are the ACID properties in the context of MongoDB transactions?\n","\n","Ans: MongoDB supports ACID for transactions to ensure data reliability.\n","\n","11.  What is the purpose of MongoDB’s explain() function?\n","\n","Ans: Shows how MongoDB executes a query and helps with optimization.\n","\n","12.  How does MongoDB handle schema validation?\n","\n","Ans: MongoDB allows setting rules for document structure using JSON Schema.\n","\n","13.  What is the difference between a primary and a secondary node in a replica set?\n","\n","Ans: Primary handles reads/writes; secondaries replicate data and handle reads.\n","\n","14.  What security mechanisms does MongoDB provide for data protection?\n","\n","Ans:  Authentication, authorization, encryption (TLS/SSL, at-rest), and auditing.\n","\n","15.  Explain the concept of embedded documents and when they should be used?\n","\n","Ans: Store related data in the same document for better read performance.\n","\n","16.  What is the purpose of MongoDB’s $lookup stage in aggregation?\n","\n","Ans: Joins documents from two collections, like a SQL JOIN.\n","\n","17.  What are some common use cases for MongoDB?\n","\n","Ans: Real-time analytics, content management, IoT, e-commerce, mobile apps.\n","\n","18.  What are the advantages of using MongoDB for horizontal scaling?\n","\n","Ans: Improves performance, distributes load, handles large datasets efficiently.\n","\n","19.  How do MongoDB transactions differ from SQL transactions?\n","\n","Ans: MongoDB supports multi-document ACID transactions but with different syntax.\n","\n","20.  What are the main differences between capped collections and regular collections?\n","\n","Ans: Capped collections have fixed size and auto-remove oldest data; regular do not.\n","\n","21.  What is the purpose of the $match stage in MongoDB’s aggregation pipeline?\n","\n","Ans: Filters documents in the pipeline, like a WHERE clause.\n","\n","22.  How can you secure access to a MongoDB database?\n","\n","Ans:Use authentication, IP whitelisting, TLS, and role-based access.\n","\n","23.  What is MongoDB’s WiredTiger storage engine, and why is it important??\n","\n","Ans: Default engine in MongoDB; supports compression, concurrency, and performance."],"metadata":{"id":"IVEg6XE8CeBx"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#practical\n","\n","#1.
